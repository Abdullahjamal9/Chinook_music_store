# Chinook_music_store
This repository hosts a data analysis project focused on the Chinook music store dataset. Leveraging SQL queries and Python programming, the analysis delves into various aspects of the store's sales and customer behavior. Key insights include the dominance of album purchases over individual tracks, identification of unsold inventory, examination of genre popularity across different countries, determination of top-selling genres, and country-wise analysis to understand sales patterns and customer demographics. By exploring these facets, the project aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory management, refining marketing strategies, and enhancing customer engagement in the music retail industry.
